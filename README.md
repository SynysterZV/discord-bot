# discord-bot

This is just a little project im doing in my free time, 
If you do decide you want to download the bot, make sure
to run 'npm install' in the project directory to download
the node_modules needed. Also, dont forget to run sync.bat to make
sure the database is created BEFORE you run the bot.
